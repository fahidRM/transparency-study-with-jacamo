This project aims to promote the MultiAgent Programming (MAP) approach by providing a suitable integration of tools and languages for programming the following dimensions: agents (http://jason.sf.net[Jason]), environment (http://cartago.sourceforge.net/[Cartago]), and organisation (http://moise.sf.net[Moise]).

== Getting Started Guides

If youâ€™re just getting to know JaCaMo or tackling programming your first multi-agent program, these guides are for you! All you need is a few minutes. The only prerequisites are a JaCaMo platform installed, a JDK and a text editor.

== Tutorials

With the following tutorials you will experience deeper, in-context explorations and practices of multi-agent oriented programming topics.
// After the practice of these tutorials, you will be ready to implement real-world multiagent solutions.
